            <h2>My Goal</h2>
            <p>My goal is to give my expirences with traveling as someone who has been recently dignosed with celiac to help keep others informed. It is not an easy to be someone who has this and loves to travel but I hope my expirences help others as well.</p>

            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>What is celiac?: Celiac is an auto immune disorder that after ingesting food that can cause a quite a few outcomes. In my case it causes flu like symptoms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What are ways I have found to locate safe food?: I do still find it dificult to be 100% certain about places but I would suggest always looking online. another way I have found to check is by asking the servers in the restrant how safe they think it would be. 
                        it seems simple but it can still be dificult to be 100% sure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What kind of reactions I have had from said "safe" places?: there have been time that say they are "Gluten Friendly" all that that means is it has food that isn't made with gluten but they don't take precutions to make sure it is safe for those with celiac.
                        I will say my reactions seem mild compared to some of the reactions I have seen while looking at the various forms on online but as stated above my main reactions are a small fever like symptoms and feeling nauseous. but reactions may vary.</p>
