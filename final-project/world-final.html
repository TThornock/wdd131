            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>What is celiac?: Celiac is an auto immune disorder that after ingesting food that has gluten in it can cause a quite a few side effects as the body can't break down gluten that is help in the food. In my case it causes flu like symptoms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What are ways I have found to locate safe food?: I do still find it difficult to be 100% certain about places but I would suggest always looking online. another way I have found to check is by asking the servers in the restaurant how safe they think it would be. 
                        it seems simple but it can still be difficult to be 100% sure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>What kind of reactions I have had from said "safe" places?: there have been time that say they are "Gluten Friendly" all that that means is it has food that isn't made with gluten but they don't take precautions to make sure it is safe for those with celiac.
                        I will say my reactions seem mild compared to some of the reactions I have seen while looking at the various forums online but as stated above my main reactions are a small fever like symptoms and feeling nauseous. but reactions may vary.</p>
