        <h1>Celiac Travel Log</h1>
        <p>the reason I chose the name Celiac Travel Logs is beacuse I was orgianly going to just put together something with just disney in mind but with it being travel logs its keeps it open to adding diffrent pages for new locations I travel to.</p>
        <p>Optinal url: celiac-travel-log.org or celiac-travel-log.com. which ever is appliciable.  im going to be honest im confused on this part.</p>

            <p>My goal is to give my expirences with traveling as someone who has been recently dignosed with celiac to help keep others informed. It is not an easy to be someone who has this and loves to travel but I hope my expirences help others as well.</p>
