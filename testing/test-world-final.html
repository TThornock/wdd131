            <h2>Disney World Overview</h2>
            <p>During my visit to Disney World in 2024, I found that most locations were exceptionally accommodating. 
                Many of the restaurants I dined at provided a binder containing detailed information about which foods were safe for various allergies. 
                Below, I will highlight a few noteworthy dining options from the parks.</p>

        <section class="park-1">
            <h2>Hollywood Studios</h2>
            <p class="info">California Adventure is a park I look forward to visiting for many reasons, the foremost being its Star Wars attractions.</p>
            <picture><img src="images/drink.jpg" alt="star wars Oga's" loading="lazy"></picture>
            <p class="exp">Galaxy`s Edge is the section of the park themed around Star Wars. The standout locations there were Oga`s Cantina and Ronto Roasters. 
                Oga`s isn`t known for its food, but rather for its creatively themed beverages. The server was attentive and provided a binder so we could check which options were available for me. 
                Ronto Roasters was a pleasant surprise, offering a gluten-free pita for their signature wrap.</p>

            <h2>Epcot</h2>
            <p class="info">Epcot is a park dedicated to “traveling” the world and celebrating global culture through locations inspired by different countries.</p>
            <picture><img src="images/epcot-ball.jpg" alt="Epcot ball" loading="lazy"></picture>
            <p class="exp">Epcot offered a wide variety of excellent food and experiences. One standout was Tutto Italia. 
                Although the selection was somewhat limited, they were able to prepare most pastas gluten-free, as well as a swordfish steak. 
                Another notable restaurant was Spice Road, located in the Morocco part of the park, which served an incredible spiced lamb kefta.</p>
